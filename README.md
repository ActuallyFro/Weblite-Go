Weblite-Go (v0.1.1)
===================
This tool is based on the example, C-based webserver [program "weblite" by Dr. Ken Christensen](http://www.csee.usf.edu/~kchriste/tools/toolpage.html#tcpip).
The intent of this program is to keep the spirit of weblite (simple, and direct), while adding the minimal needed additions to make the code a standalone program (e.g., help message, license file, debugging, and some exception handling).

Mostly, this is a proof of concept I plan to use with my Raspberry Pi.

Patch Notes
-----------
v0.1.1 - Had every file, except index.html, be served as a file download. Now html files should be rendered.
